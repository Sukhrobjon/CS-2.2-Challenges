# CS-2.2-Challenges
This course covers graph theory, data structures, algorithms, and analysis. Key concepts include recursion, greedy algorithms, memoization and dynamic programming. Students will build an original project whose underlying structure requires the use of graph structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems such as airplane routing, social networking, and board games.
